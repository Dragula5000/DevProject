The Files In here were my First Attempt at a website create while I learned as I went, There are alot of Errors, However I'm Keeping it up as a reminder of where I Began My Academic Journey. -C.J (A.K.A Dragula)

All HTML files are linked with an individual CSS file on each HTML iteration. The Purpose of doing so was to create a sidebar to navigate between the web pages. I had done so using the <table> element for a rudimentary structure until I learned how to do so using CSS, All positions have been kept as static with tweaks and changes to the fonts using manual insertion using various .tff and .otf files asI had found the extent of the Google API to be too limiting towards creativity. It is important to note that all PROFESSIONALY done sites have been made using Google API insertion through CSS.
  
The Original Purpose was Practice and to allow Personal Expression while the contents are a makeshift advertisment of the services I provide on the side.
